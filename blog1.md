# Exploring distant worlds in our galaxy 
## **Post 1**
### As humans realize that earth no longer has very much native land to explore, we crave and strive for finding what is next, where to explore, and what the future could hold for our species. Begining to send humans and robots to distant worlds may be the direction of the future of the species, however, we must find where the best places are for us to travel before we make a long and daunting journey to a distant world. Through robots and cameras, we can get samples and inside looks to these lands which can help us determine where the next best place is for us to explore.

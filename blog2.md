# Exploring distant stars in our galaxy
## **Post 2**
### Exploring distant stars goes hand in hand with exploring distant worlds and planets for humans to live on in the future. Some stars may make these worlds uninhabitable, and others may make planets the perfect temprature to handle life and sustain the proper conditions for water and other elements needed to keep life in a flurishing state.
### As we continue to make discoveries and revolutionary upgrades to our equipment and machinery, we will soon be able to discover even more about worlds that may lead to us as a species finding a new home.
